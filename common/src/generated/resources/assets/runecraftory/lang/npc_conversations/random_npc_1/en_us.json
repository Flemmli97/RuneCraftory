  "npc.generic.1.divorce.fail.3": "Huh? Why are you giving me that?",
  "npc.generic.1.procreation.fail.1": "I understand, but I\u2019m not sure I want that right now.",
  "npc.generic.1.procreation.fail.2": "It's a big decision, and I\u2019m not comfortable with it at this time.",
  "npc.generic.1.procreation.fail.3": "I don't feel like we're in the right place for that yet.",
  "npc.generic.quest.tame_monster.start": "Did you know that you can tame the monsters in this world?\nYou would need to setup a barn first and then just give them an item.\n\nWith that said I would like you to tame a monster.",
